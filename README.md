# LocalBrew

This is a .NET MVC web app that displays basic information about Breweries in Harrisburg, PA.
The app provides an option to display brewery details including an interactive google map. The app follows the repository pattern (sans map) and utilizes dependency injection. The app calls an API and returns brewery data which is then parsed and assigned to a brewery model then the controller references the model to display to the view. The app has basic exception handling and styling.  As with every exercise, there is room for improvement and I have a list of things I would do differently or add - like a user input feature to retrieve brewery data for any location available via the Open Brewery DB.  Thanks for giving this a look!
